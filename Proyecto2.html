            <li><h3>¿What is a 5K run?</h3>
            <p><strong>Runner 5k:</strong> For new <em>runners</em> who want to train to complete a race, 5K
                competitions<br>
                are an ideal starting point. They are races with a length of 5 kilometers where each runner can<br>
                give their best, in a relatively short time and distance.<br>
                There are many 5k events, ranging from popular races to highly competitive races for the most<br>
                experienced. These events are very popular with both new and experienced runners, and are a great<br>
                way to raise money for a good cause.<br>
            </p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>¿Is it difficult to run 5 km?</h3>
            <p><strong>If you're just starting out running:</strong> <em>5km might</em> seem like a long distance, but
                there are plenty<br>
                of tried and tested training plans, like the ones we show you HERE, that will get you from your couch to
                the<br>
                finish line in a matter of weeks. Once you're comfortable with the distance, you can start working on
                improving<br>
                your speed and the time it takes to cover those 5Ks.<br> </li>

            <h3>¿What is a 10K race?</h3>
            <p><strong>Runner 10k:</strong> <em>A 10k race</em> has a distance of 10 kilometers. It is ideal for
                experienced runners looking for<br>
                more of a challenge. It is the second most popular race after the half marathon and requires a level of
                fitness that balances<br>
                strength, energy and stamina.<br>
                If you've already run a 5K and like to run longer distances, the 10K may be the ideal next step.
                Completing a 10km race is an<br>
                achievement in itself, being able to be happy with your time no matter what. However, it is normal that
                you want to share with<br>
                other runners, as well as with your previous best times.<br>
                Your age, cardiovascular condition, and musculoskeletal health can influence your individual
                performance, but the average 10K<br>
                time is 50 to 70 minutes.<br>
            </p>
            <h3>Average time of a 10K race</h3>
            <p><strong>if you are going to run 10k:</strong> <em>Most runners</em> who are reasonably fit and run an
                average of 25 to 50 km per week should finish<br>
                this type of race in an average time of 50 to 70 minutes. More advanced runners usually finish in about
                43 to 50 minutes. While<br>
                exceptionally fit runners can average under 40 minutes, while more casual runners can exceed 60 minutes
                to cover those 10 kilometers.<br>

            <h3>¿Do you know what a half marathon or 21K race is?</h3>
            <p><strong>21k race:</strong> <em>is a race</em> that is exactly 21.0975 km long, half a marathon or 42K,
                which is 42.195 km. In the grandest scheme of all races,<br>
                the half marathon is in the middle of the road for racing.<br>
            </p>
            <h3>¿Why run a half marathon?</h3>
            <p><strong>A half marathon is a good distance:</strong> <em>to try new</em> challenges after running other
                distances like 5K or 10K. There are few races between a 10K race<br>
                and a half marathon. 15K races do exist, but they are extremely rare. A 21K gives you the chance to run
                half the distance of a marathon and experience double the fun.<br>
                When you cross the finish line of the half marathon, you will have accomplished something that less than
                90% of the world will ever do. This is a great achievement and<br>
                the memory will stay with you for the rest of your life. After your first half marathon race, you'll
                probably be hooked and want to run your next race as soon as possible.<br>
